The spring project template was provided in CS3200 Database Design along with [this](https://github.com/jannunzi/wap.git) template.
I thoroughly enjoyed the final project in CS3200 and created this to do list to solidify what I learned from my final project, improve my design skills, and stay organized next semester.
